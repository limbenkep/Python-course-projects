# Laboration 2  
## Environment & Tools 
Window 10 pro, PyCharm 2021.2.1(Professional edition), Python 3.9.6,git version 2.33.0.windows.2 

## Purpose
The purpose of the laboration is to provide practical experience in regards toâ€¦  
- Usage of strings!  
- Usage of functions!  
- User input, interaction and validation!  

## Procedure
To fulfill the aim of this lab I implemented psuedocodes for a User authentication program that checks users 
username and password if the pair is contained in the list of credentials for which access is granted. 
I completed the code for functions to format username, decrypt password and authenticate user's credentials 
in the provided program file assignment.py, according to instructions provided in the lab description

## Discussion  
I believe i have fulfilled the purpose of the lab. I practiced the use of Strings during the course of handling 
the username and password. I practiced iteration over a string, String concatenation, methods like lower(), 
capitalize(), enumerate(), as well as the use of build-ins like len(). I also practiced writing functions by 
completing the provided functions as well as writing nested functions to shift character, and rotate ASCII value.
Overall I think the material provided was sufficient to do the laboratory. I find the example files for each 
section extra useful to summarise al that has been read from the different source. The main challenge for this lab was 
understanding the lab requirements.
