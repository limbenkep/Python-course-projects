# Laboration 3 
## Environment & Tools 
Window 10 pro, PyCharm 2021.2.1(Professional edition), Python 3.9.6,git version 2.33.0.windows.2 

## Purpose
The purpose of the laboration is to provide practical experience in regards toâ€¦  
- Iterative and recursive implementations!
- Working with function decoration!
- File handling!
- Usage of custom loggers!
- Separation of concerns!
- Creation of well-structured program code!  

## Procedure
To fulfill the aim of this lab I implemented pseudocode for a program that compares the computation
speed for three methods of implementation of the fibonacci series namely the iterative method, the 
recursive method and memory recursive method which stores computer values in a container. For a 
provided value, or default 30 if not provided, the fibonacci values of numbers from n to zero is 
computer for each method and the computation time measured. The sequence and fibonacci value is stored 
to a file and the durations for each method is printed to the console. An info message is logged 
at the beginning of every measurement and a debug data is logged for every 5th values computed.

## Discussion  
I believe i have fulfilled the purpose of the lab. I practiced the use of recursive implementations 
by implementing the pseudocode of the recursive_memory method. I also practiced working with 
function decoration by implementing the measurement_decorator function. By writing the create_logger
function I practiced the use of custom loggers.
I believe I have met the goal of this laboratory.
